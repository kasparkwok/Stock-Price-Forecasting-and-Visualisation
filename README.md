# Stock-Price-Forecasting-and-Visualisation

# Aim
The aim of this final project is two folded:
1. Visualisation of a particular stock using different indicators.
2. Utilisation of various machine learning models to predict the price movement of the stock.

# Content

## 1. Data Collection
- Use Alpha Vantage to fetch live stock data
